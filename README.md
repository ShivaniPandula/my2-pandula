###### Gokarna
 I like Gokarrna because of the **beautiful scenic places and wonderful oceans**. Basically it is located in the western Ghats so the way to reach gokarna is adventurous and thrilling. It is very much famous for beaches and sunsets. We have unique water games in beaches which attracts the visitors. Here, the sunsets are incredibly beautiful, **lighting up the island with a warm golden glow** as it sinks beyond the horizon.
